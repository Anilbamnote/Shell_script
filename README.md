BASICS OF SHELL SCRIPTING


What is a Shell Script:-

A shell script is a text file containing a series of commands that would normally be typed into a command line interface. Instead of typing commands one by one, you can save them in a file and execute them all at once.


Key Characteristics:-

- File Extension: Usually ends with .sh (though not required).
- Executable: Made executable with the chmod +x scriptname.sh command.
- Interpreter Line: Often starts with a "shebang" line like #!/bin/bash to specify which shell to use.

Common Uses:
- jenkins
- ancible 
- teraform
- Automating repetitive tasks
- System administration and maintenance
- File management operations
- Setting up development environments
- Running backup procedures
- Processing data in batches
